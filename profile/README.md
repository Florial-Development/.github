*SUBJECT TO CHANGE*
##

### Welcome to Florial

Project Florial (name undecided) is an indie game in development. Some of core features are exploring the story. You live in a mountainous region known as The Cascades. Your primary goal is leading your clan of foxes through generations. They look to you for everything. You will watch one generation be born, you will name them, and bless them in your name. You will train them, send them out to get food and to fight for your clan. You will watch them grow old, choose a mate, and maybe have kits of their own at some point. By then, your devoted clan member will be old. They can no longer do much, so the rest of your clan will care for them. Eventually, they die, and pass on. It's the circle of life, and just another to add to your collection. You yourself are immortal, so perhaps make the best of it, and keep expanding and colonizing the area around you. You're alone, where you came from, they no longer accept you. You are not even used to living in a real body, your knowledge on the world is still limited. Even so, There is still one being in the world who you can love and trust. You should probably protect her with your life and the fiercity of your clan. But won't that be hard when someone gets in the way? Just so happens.. they love her too. Life isn't fair, you begin to realize that here. You're the /right/ one here anyway.

## Characters - TULIP
![](https://github.com/Florial-Development/.github/blob/main/ezgif.com-video-to-gif_3.gif)

*"If my siblings must be banished, take me too"* 

**On one paw, Tulip is the man er- fox,  (wild)cat, hybrid.. in the middle. On the other paw, she just wants to live in peace and wants the others to do the same. About the only one who keeps the peace in The Cascades. And yes, if you were wondering, she loves both of them equally. It really is a shame. And it's a terribly ironic twist of fate she happens to be on both sides of the coin, both literally, and figuratively.**

## Characters - BRANN (You, the player)
![](https://github.com/Florial-Development/.github/blob/main/ezgif.com-video-to-gif_2.gif)

*"With my life, my clan is protected."*

**As adrogynous as they come, Brann, or, you, the player, is a simple fox. At least appears to be a fox, anyway... These three in the universe are the only beings that do not age. It's a good thing nobody has seemed to notice, since we're in about 800 AD.. Brann would protect their clan with their life. You as the player watch this true, as you lead the clan through multiple generations. Brann does not give up, but keeps going. You can conversate with your clanmates, yes, but they just don't understand you.. Plus, they will eventually die. The one thing keeping Brann from complete loneliness is Tulip. Maybe even immortal beings need immortal company**

## Characters - SNØ
![](https://github.com/Florial-Development/.github/blob/main/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

*"Prepare for Ragnarok."*

**Ah, Snø... Unhealthily obsessed with the impending doom of ... She shares sentiments with Brann. Her clan is her life, and she is a wildcat. At least that's what she appears to be... She lives further up The Cascades, in the snowy mountainous region. The prey is abundant more south down by the borders. You can imagine how this puts pressure on both of their clans.. Anyway, she will learn her lesson eventually... Eventually... Life isn't what it's cracked up to be on this mortal planet.**


## Development

Project Florial started development around late September on 2023, and it has been, and will continue to be coded in a series of developmental phases. Each phase will allot for around one month, but plans vary in accordance with developer conditions. Currently, we have a 9 month plan. At the end of which, we are hopefully releasing the game's first demo. Afterward, developmental phases will continue. Whilst the code will not be shared in any way. Discord Server Boosters are allowed to see commit reasons and how often the project is committed to. 

## Developmental Phase Progress


- [x] Phase zero
- [x] Phase one
- [x] Phase two 
- [x] Phase three 
- [ ] Phase four (in progress)
- [ ] Phase five
- [ ] Phase six
- [ ] Phase seven
- [ ] Phase eight
- [ ] Phase nine

## Discord Bot

To keep the community fed, we have a Discord Bot for our Discord server, in which you can unlock various lore stories about the game before it releases. You can level up, unlock stories, purchase cosmetics, and more. Whilst it is fully coded, there are plenty of ideas for expansion and updates in the future.
