### Welcome to Florial

Project Florial (name undecided) is an indie game in development. Some of core features are exploring the story. Your primary goal is leading your clan of foxes through generations. They look to you for everything. You will watch one generation be born, you will name them, and bless them in your name. You will train them, send them out to get food and to fight for your clan. You will watch them grow old, choose a mate, and maybe have kits of their own at some point. By then, your devoted clan member will be old. They can no longer do much, so the rest of your clan will care for them. Eventually, they die, and pass on. It's the circle of life, and just another to add to your collection. You yourself are immortal, so perhaps make the best of it, and keep expanding and colonizing the area around you. You're alone, where you came from, they no longer accept you. You are not even used to living in a real body, your knowledge on the world is still limited. Even so, There is still one being in the world who you can love and trust. You should probably protect her with your life and the fiercity of your clan. But won't that be hard when someone gets in the way? You're the /right/ one here anyway.

## Development

Project Florial will be coded in a series of developmental phases. Currently, we have a 9 month plan. At the end of which, we are hopefully releasing the game's first demo. Afterward, developmental phases will continue.

## Discord Bot

To keep the community fed, we have a Discord Bot for our Discord server, in which you can unlock various lore stories about the game before it releases. You can level up, unlock stories, purchase cosmetics, and more. Whilst it is fully coded, there are plenty of ideas for expansion and updates in the future.
