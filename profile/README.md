*SUBJECT TO CHANGE*

### Welcome to Florial

Project Florial (name undecided) is an indie game in development. Some of core features are exploring the story. You live in a mountainous region known as The Ancestral Lands. Your primary goal is leading your clan of foxes through generations. They look to you for everything. You will watch one generation be born, you will name them, and bless them in your name. You will train them, send them out to get food and to fight for your clan. You will watch them grow old, choose a mate, and maybe have kits of their own at some point. By then, your devoted clan member will be old. They can no longer do much, so the rest of your clan will care for them. Eventually, they die, and pass on. It's the circle of life, and just another to add to your collection.

## Development

Project Florial started development around late September on 2023, and it has been, and will continue to be coded in a series of developmental phases. Each phase will allot for around one month, but plans vary in accordance with developer conditions. Currently, we have a 9 month plan. At the end of which, we are hopefully releasing the game's first demo. Afterward, developmental phases will continue. Whilst the code will not be shared in any way. Discord Server Boosters are allowed to see commit reasons and how often the project is committed to.
