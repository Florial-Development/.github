### Welcome to Florial

At Florial, we are currently aiming on a recode for our Season 6, the road will be long, but we'll do it! Florial Season 6 is where you can play Minecraft under our server's lore, you can either be a Cat or a Fox, two species who hate each other in a vast, hidden place, called the Cascades. When you choose your Species, you will transform into the animal, the player can perform various emotes like Sitting or Sleeping.

Since regular hostile mobs are absent, they are replaced by Boars, Ravagers, and other more forest-like creatures. Since most passive mobs are gone too, you'll need to use your nose to find food. You can upgrade your core survival animal skils, burrow as a fox, or level your mobility as a cat. Using your nose is the most important thing one can do in this world for survival, next to making chocolates, right below getting DNA to evolve further.

Florial will utilize a custom required resourcepack and henceforth have custom-art GUIS, among other fun things.

..Or you can just be a human.
