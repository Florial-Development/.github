### Brann's Burrow: What is it about?

Brann's Burrow: Tails from the Den ð“ƒ¦ is a game about managing your fox skulk through multiple generations. You allow them to breed, raise offspring, train them, and send them to fight for territory and hunt to keep your skulk fed. Here's the setting: "The Cascades" a wide, mountainous region with lush forests below and blizzarding mountains above.

You play as Brann, an immortal fox tasked with an integral duty: Leading a skulk, and fending off the north. Skulk law is important and integral to skulk life for a fox, you should live by it, too. The world is unforgiving, harsh, and the northern foxes pose a bigger threat than ever. How will you lead your skulk?

## Development

Brann's Burrow starting developed around late September 2023, developed in a series of "phases." Now it is developed through official updates. Our updates are listed on our Trello and we work month after month to finish them and move onto the next thing until we are able to put out an official, playable pre-alpha release known as our 0.1.0 update. The project is not open source nor is it ever planned to be.

## "Kin first, your own paw second" is the most important rule of skulk life
